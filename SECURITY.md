# Security Policy

At `doc-extract-parse-index`, we take security seriously. This document outlines our security policy and guidelines for reporting vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue, please report it to us as soon as possible.

**Please DO NOT open a public GitHub issue.** Instead, please send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) (replace with actual security contact if available).

In your report, please include:

-   A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
-   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
-   The potential impact of the vulnerability.
-   Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots (if applicable).
-   Your contact information (optional).

We will acknowledge your report within 2-3 business days and provide regular updates on the remediation process.

## Security Best Practices

While developing and deploying `doc-extract-parse-index`, we strive to adhere to the following security best practices:

-   **Input Validation:** All user inputs are rigorously validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
-   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth) for user access control.
-   **Dependency Management:** Regularly update and audit third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `pip-audit` or `npm audit`.
-   **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement secure error handling to prevent information disclosure and log security-related events for auditing.
-   **Configuration Management:** Securely manage sensitive configurations (e.g., API keys, database credentials) using environment variables or secret management tools.
-   **API Security:** Implement rate limiting, API key authentication, and proper access controls for API endpoints.
-   **Data Protection:** Ensure sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
-   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing.
-   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that services and users operate with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Dependencies

We rely on various third-party libraries and frameworks. We make efforts to keep these dependencies up to date to mitigate known vulnerabilities. Contributors are encouraged to report any outdated or vulnerable dependencies they identify.
